# MarksmanshipTracker
Web2Py application for tracking junior rifle marksmanship progress.

Nothing much here yet but the basic structures.

Will be placing more here in the coming months as time permits with target date of 9/2015 for a first working version.

Authentication is purposefully disabled at this time while prototyping gets out of the way as is SSL.

DO NOT DEPLOY THIS TO A PUBLIC FACING LOCATION.
